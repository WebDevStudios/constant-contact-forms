The official Constant Contact plugin adds a contact form to your WordPress site to quickly capture information from visitors.

== Description ==

**Constant Contact Forms** makes it fast and easy to capture visitor information right from your WordPress site. Whether you’re looking to collect email addresses, contact info, event sign-ups, or visitor feedback, you can customize your forms with data fields that work best for you. Best of all, this plugin is available to all WordPress users, even if you don’t have a Constant Contact account.

**Constant Contact Forms** allows you to:

* Create forms that are clear, simple, and mobile-optimized for every device.
* Choose forms that automatically select the theme and style of your WordPress site.
* Customize data fields, so you can tailor the type of information you collect.

BONUS: If you have a Constant Contact account, all new email addresses that you capture will be automatically added to the Constant Contact email lists of your choosing. Not a Constant Contact customer? Sign up for a Free Trial right from the plugin.

**Constant Contact Forms** requires a PHP version of 5.4 or higher. You will not be able to use if on a lower version. Talk to your system administrator or hosting company if you are not sure what version you are on.
