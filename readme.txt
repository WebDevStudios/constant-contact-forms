#### How do I include which custom fields labels are which custom field values in my Constant Contact Account?
You can add this to your active theme or custom plugin: `add_filter( 'constant_contact_include_custom_field_label', '__return_true' );`. Note: custom fields have a max length of 50 characters. Including the labels will subtract from the 50 character total available.

#### Which account level access is needed to connect my WordPress account to Constant Contact?
You will need to make the connection to Constant Contact using the credentials of the account owner. Campaign manager credentials will not have enough access.

### Error: Please select at least one list to subscribe to.
Some users are experiencing errors when upgrading from an older version of the plugin. If you are receiving an error "Please select at least one list to subscribe to" on your form submissions we recommend "Sync Lists with Constant Contact", this can be found in your admin dashboard Contact Form > Lists. If problem still persists we recommend recreating the form from scratch.

== Upgrade Notice ==
* We will soon be releasing a version of Constant Contact Forms that has a major upgrade to our API behind the scenes. Information will be provided at the time to help ease the process. You should not need to recreate any existing forms, but will need to re-authenticate.
